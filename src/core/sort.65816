;just a static hook for sort so that out-of-bounds sorts can happen after objects of a frame have been processed
;(reason: if sorting inside object, it's possible to sort objects in such a way, that some get executed twice, some not at all for a given frame)

.include "src/core/sort.h"
.section "sort"

.ends
